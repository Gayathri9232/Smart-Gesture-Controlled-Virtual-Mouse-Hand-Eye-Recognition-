# Smart-Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse-Hand-Eye-Recognition-
This project introduces a virtual mouse system controlled by hand and eye gestures. It uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to track finger and facial movements in real time. The system enables touchless interaction, ideal for accessibility and contact-free environments.
